##README
This game was the winning entry to the Microsoft sponsored Berlin Mini Games Jam at Game Academy in June 2013.

It was written and recorded in about 10 hours.

###What is it?
It's a choose your own adventure style game delivered almost entirely with audio, just the occasional set of choices where the narrative branches. It utilises the excellent  [buzz.js](http://https://github.com/jaysalvat/buzz) library, [jQuery 2.0.0](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) (because it needed to be developed quickly not because I fear straight JS!) and normal old HTML5.

###Where's the audio?
To keep the binaries out of the repository and therefore keep it relatively lightweight the [audio can be downloaded from here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ngws4r729bswajj/dKGGDrbqcI)
